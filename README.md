Zeebe Kafka Exporter
=====================

An easy to use exporter which will export Zeebe records to a configured Kafka topic, compatible with
[zeebe](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe) versions:

- [0.20.0](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/releases/tag/0.20.0)

For more information about the exporters please read the [Exporter documentation](https://docs.zeebe.io/basics/exporters.html).

> This is a work in progress; you're welcome to contribute code or ideas, but no guarantees are made about the exporter itself.
Use at your own risks.

## Trying it out

The quickest way to get started is after cloning the project:

```sh
mvn clean install
docker-compose up -d zeebe kafka zookeeper consumer
```

Then you can view the exported topics by checking the consumer logs:

```sh
docker logs -f consumer
```

## Installation

The quickest way to get started is:

1. Download the latest release (`zeebe-kafka-exporter-*-uber.jar`).
1. Copy it to the `lib/` folder of your Zeebe brokers.
1. Copy the configuration from `exporter.kafka.cfg.toml` into each broker's `zeebe.cfg.toml` (e.g. append it at the end).
1. Update the configuration's list of servers to point to your Kafka instances.

The next time you start your Zeebe cluster, all event-type records will be exported to their respective Kafka topics.

## Usage

The exporter is set up to stream records from Zeebe to Kafka as they are processed by the exporter stream processor.
While this is done asynchronously, to ensure that the position is updated correctly, it keeps buffers in flight requests
and processes their results in the order they were sent, not necessarily in the order the Kafka cluster answered.

Records are serialized to Kafka using
[a common protobuf schema](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-exporter-protobuf/blob/master/src/main/proto/schema.proto),
where there is one message per record kind (e.g. deployment, job, variable).

The [configuration file](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/blob/master/exporter/exporter.kafka.cfg.toml)
is a good starting point to learn more about how the exporter works.

### Advanced configuration

You can configure the producer for more advanced use cases by using the `[exporters.args.producer]` table, in which you
can define arbitrary Kafka producer settings. So for example, to configure two way SSL handshake:

```toml
# ...

[exporter.args.producer]
"security.protocol" = "SSL"
"ssl.truststore.location" = "/var/private/ssl/kafka.client.truststore.jks"
"ssl.truststore.password" = "test1234"
"ssl.keystore.location" = "/var/private/ssl/kafka.client.keystore.jks"
"ssl.keystore.password" = "test1234"
"ssl.key.password" = "test1234"

# ...
```

## Examples

In the [zeebe-kafka-exporter-samples](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/tree/master/samples) module, you
can find examples of different consumers.

### Generic record consumer

Although records are serialized using a different Protobuf message per topic, it is possible to read from multiple
topics by using a `GenericRecordDeserializer`. It relies on the fact that the producer in the exporter uses a
`GenericRecordSerializer` by default, which will serialize a record as a normal `SchemaSerializer<?>` would, but will
additionally write the schema descriptor type in the record headers. This allows the consumer to then deserialize the
message to its correct type, be it `Schema.DeploymentRecord` or `Schema.VariableRecord`.

> This has the unfortunate side effect that you must write code to unpack the message to a concrete type should you need
to; any improvements here would welcome.

An example of a consumer reading from all `zeebe-*` prefixed topics:

```java
final Consumer<Schema.RecordId, GenericRecord> consumer =
    new KafkaConsumer<>(config, new RecordIdDeserializer(), new GenericRecordDeserializer());
consumer.subscribe(Pattern.compile("^zeebe-.*$"));
while (true) {
  final ConsumerRecords<Schema.RecordId, GenericRecord> consumed =
      consumer.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(2));
  for (ConsumerRecord<Schema.RecordId, GenericRecord> record : consumed) {
    logger.info(
        "================[{}] {}-{} ================",
        record.topic(),
        record.key().getPartitionId(),
        record.key().getPosition());
    logger.info("{}", record.value().getMessage().toString());
  }
}
```

### Single topic consumer

Since records are serialized using the same Protobuf message for a single topic, it's possible to consume them and
handle the concrete type directly by using a `SchemaDeserializer<?>` for that type. For example, the following will
consume only workflow instance records, and in the inner loop, the record value is simply the Protobuf message.

```java
final Consumer<Schema.RecordId, Schema.WorkflowInstanceRecord> consumer =
    new KafkaConsumer<>(
        config,
        new RecordIdDeserializer(),
        new SchemaDeserializer<>(Schema.WorkflowInstanceRecord.parser()));
consumer.subscribe(Collections.singleton("zeebe-workflow"));

while (true) {
  final ConsumerRecords<Schema.RecordId, Schema.WorkflowInstanceRecord> consumed =
      consumer.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(2));
  for (ConsumerRecord<Schema.RecordId, Schema.WorkflowInstanceRecord> record : consumed) {
    logger.info(
        "================[{}] {}-{} ================",
        record.topic(),
        record.key().getPartitionId(),
        record.key().getPosition());
    logger.info("{}", record.value().toString());
}
```

## Docker

The [exporter](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/tree/master/exporter) and
[samples](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe-kafka-exporter/tree/master/samples) modules both come with their own
`Dockerfile`; the exporter's will spawn a standard `zeebe` container with a pre-configured exporter, and the samples'
will spawn an OpenJDK container running the `GenericConsumer` example in a loop.

From the root of the project, you can use `docker-compose up -d` to start a `zookeeper`/`kafka` pair (with ports `2181`
and `29092` exposed respectively), a `zeebe` broker/gateway (client port `25600`), and a generic consumer which will
output all records being exported. This is meant primarily to get a feel of how the whole thing works together.

## Reference

The exporter uses a Kafka producer to push records out to different topics based on the incoming record value type (e.g. deployment, raft, etc.)

The producer is configured to be an idempotent producer which will retry a record "forever"; there is a delivery timeout configured, but the timeout is set
to ~25 days, which for most use cases should be enough to fix any recoverable errors. In the case of unrecoverable errors, unfortunately a restart is pretty much
the only solution at the moment, although community contributions are very welcome to fix this.

The main reason records are retried forever is that Zeebe processes records sequentially, and to ensure we've exported a record, we can't update Zeebe and say record 2
has been exported if we can't guarantee that previous records have also been exported (or in Kafka terms, acknowledged).

To take advantage of the asynchronous API and minimize blocking operations, the exporter keeps a queue of in-flight record futures (configurable) and will
export records until that queue is full; once full, it will block until the first element (i.e. the oldest sent record) has been acknowledged by Kafka, at which point
it will then send the next record and resume operation.

At the same time, a background job is scheduled every second to flush the queue of any completed records. So in a best case scenario the queue always has some space and
the exporter never blocks.

## Configuration

A sample configuration file is included in the project under `exporter.kafka.cfg.toml`.

> NOTE: there is currently a bug where the TOML parser used in Zeebe parses all numbers as doubles, which if passed
directly as `ProducerConfig` may cause errors. It's recommended for now to use the extra config arguments for
non-numerial values until that's fixed.

```toml
[[exporters]]
id = "kafka"
className = "io.zeebe.exporters.kafka.KafkaExporter"

  # Top level exporter arguments

  # any acknowledgment Once the limit is reached the exporter will block and
  # wait until either one record is acknowledged
  maxInFlightRecords = 1000
  # How often should the exporter drain the in flight records' queue of completed
  # requests and update the broker with the guaranteed latest exported position
  inFlightRecordCheckIntervalMs = 1000

  # Producer specific configuration
  [exporters.args.producer]
  # The list of initial Kafka broker contact points. The format should be the same
  # one as the ProducerConfig expects, i.e. "host:port"
  # Maps to ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG

  # Controls how long the producer will wait for a request to be acknowledged by
  # the Kafka broker before retrying it
  # Maps to ProducerConfig.REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG
  requestTimeoutMs = 5000
  # Grace period when shutting down the producer in milliseconds

  # Max concurrent requests to the Kafka broker; note that in flight records are batched such that

  maxConcurrentRequests = 3

  # Any setting under the following section will be passed verbatim to

  # idempotency, delivery timeout, and retries, unless you know what you're doing
  [exporters.args.producer.config]

  # send the record to "zeebe-deployment" topic.
  #
  # Type is a list of accepted record types, allowing you to filter
