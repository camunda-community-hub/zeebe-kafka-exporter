/**
 * A dumb client for the DebugHttpExporter. This exporter starts a server on a single broker for all
 * known partitions (of that broker), and simply exposes a poll mechanism for the records.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: the server returns records in reverse order, from newest to oldest, which is the
 * opposite of what we typically want, i.e. sorted in causal order. The {@link #streamRecords()}
 * method therefore returns them reversed.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: the streaming is "dumb", and really only returns the records from the server as is as a
 * stream. This is fine for now since we typically don't have a lot of records, but it means you may
 * have to call the method multiple times.
